Follow the given steps to make the app workable in your system environment:

- Download the repository
- Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies, afterwards run the following commands to install them correctly
- npm install react-native
- npm install @react-navigation/native
- npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
- npm install react-native-svg
- npm install react-native-shadow-2
- npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler
- npm install react-native-reanimated (Onwards open the following link: "https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation/" and configure your
  babel.config.js file and reset npm start cache on following the documentations instructions)

If there are any errors after installing all of the above mentioned packages then go through the error and find the module/dependency you might be missing. Google out the right syntax command to "npm install/npm i" it.

<strong> One point worth mentioning is that you might get an android gradle or build error incase you are using some other android version. For that particular case, Just go through how the react-native official documentation is trying to fill us in for setting up our environment. Those are exactly the same SDKs and packages I have personally used while creating this codebase. </strong>
